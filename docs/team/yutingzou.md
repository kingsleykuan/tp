Hi I'm Yuting, a year 4 Business Analytics student. I like to cook and explore nice food in every city I visit :)

## Project: Tutor Tracker

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view an individual tutor.
  * What it does: allows the user to view an individual tutor with a specified index in the Tutor Tracker.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can select to view a particular
  tutor of interest, including details such as a tutor's profile and cost of different subjects.
  * Highlights: This feature is an extension from the existing feature - list tutors. It is affected by other commands
  that change the student panel in GUI because this feature depends on the index of a tutor in the list at the time 
    when the command is entered.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all tutors.
  * What it does: allows the user to view a full list of all existing tutors.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can select to view a particular
    tutor of interest, including details such as a tutor's profile and cost of different subjects.
  * Highlights: This feature is an extension from the existing feature - list tutors. It is affected by other commands
    that change the student panel in GUI because this feature depends on the index of a tutor in the list at the time
    when the command is entered.

* **New Feature**: Implemented Grade and GradeList class.
  * What it does: allows the user to create new Grade objects and store them in the GradeList in Tutor Tracker.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it extends the usability of the product by allowing user to store grades in Tutor Tracker.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects all grade-related commands to be added in the future.
  * Links: [#126](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/126)
  * Credits: Codes are adapted from `Person` in AddressBook 3.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a grade record.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a new grade record, including the subject, graded item and grade to the GradeBook.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it extends the usability of the product. 
    It provides the user a convenient way to add their grade records to the digital GradeBook for reference when choosing tutors.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects all grade-related commands to be added in the future.
    The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing model, logic, storage and ui.
  * Links: [#144](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/144) </br>
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete an existing grade record.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a grade record that is outdated.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the grade records in the GradeBook can be outdated when the user is promoted.
    the app should provide a convenient way to keep the digital GradeBook updated.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects all grade-related commands to be added in the future.
      The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing model, logic, storage and ui. </br>

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a grade record.
  * What it does: allows the user to edit an existing grade record with a specified index.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can make mistakes when adding a new grade
    and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required changes to the existing model, logic, storage and ui.
