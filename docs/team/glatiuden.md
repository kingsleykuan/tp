## Project: Tutor Tracker
**Tutor Tracker** is a desktop tuition management application meant for secondary students to track their tuition information, such as upcoming tuition appointments and tutor's contact information.
It focuses on the Command Line Interface (CLI) while providing users with a simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `list_appointments`, `find_appointment` and `view_appointment`.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all the appointments, finding appointments based on tutor's name and viewing appointments on a certain date in the Tutor Tracker.
  * Justification: This feature provides the basic necessity in the application as it allows tutees to track their appointments.
  * Highlights: It mainly supports the GUI in displaying the list of appointments of the tutees. 
  * Credits: Codes are adapted from `ListCommand` and `FindCommand` in AddressBook 3.

* **New Feature**: Implemented Event class.
  * What it does: serves as a superclass of Appointment and Schedule to ease of validation and GUI enhancement.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it extends the usability of the product by providing supporting methods in validations and timetable GUI in Tutor Tracker.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects all event-related commands to be added in the future.
  * Link: [#142](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/142) 

* **New Feature**: Implemented DateTimeValidationUtil.
  * What it does: serves as a thorough validation method to ensure the new Appointment and Schedule does not violate the datetime constraints.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it extends the usability of the product by ensuring data integrity in Tutor Tracker.
  * Highlights: This method is used in `AddAppointmentCommand`, `EditAppointmentCommand`, `AddScheduleCommand` and `EditScheduleCommand` to ensure data are tested and validated before it can be added to TutorTracker.

  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it extends the usability of the product by allowing tutees to track and manage their schedules.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects all schedule-related commands to be added in the future.
    The implementation was challenging as it required changes to the existing model, logic, storage and UI.
